# botwTextGame v1.0.0-alpha
A proof of concept conversion of the entirety of Breath of the Wild into a text based game.

Yeah. All of it.

And this is all without any professional education. Python coding is a hobby I have found as of recent.

# The Goal:
Make as much of Breath of the Wild as possible in a text based form. The story, the mechanics, the exploration aspect, everything.

I am developing this with very, very little knowledge on how to code in Python.
As such, I am making the project open source if anyone with more skill than me wishes to modify the game with more advanced code and mechanics.
I am trying to learn as much python as possible, so if anyone does manage to make some cool modifications, please share them with me via the issues section.

# Playing the Game:
If you want to launch the game, download the zip from the releases page and extract it. Windows defender might not like the BOTW.exe as its not a recognized program and is just pure python scripting, so be sure to exclude the files if you can. You also may or may not require python installed, as I havent looked into that detail yet, but in theory it should work on any PC as all the python dependencies are packed into one unit.

This project will be a long one. I'm all alone on this journey as of right now, and my Python knowledge could fit on about 3 pages. But it's a journey i'm willing to attempt.
