# botwTextGame v.0.0.3
A proof of concept conversion of the entirety of Breath of the Wild into a text based game.

The goal: Make as much of Breath of the Wild as possible in a text based form. The story, the mechanics, the exploration aspect, everything.

I am developing this with very, very little knowledge on how to code in Python.
As such, I am making the project open source if anyone with more skill than me wishes to modify the game with more advanced code and mechanics.
I am trying to learn as much python as possible, so if anyone does manage to make some cool modifications, please share them with me via the issues section.
